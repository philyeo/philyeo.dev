So I am now embarking on my first end to end project, while waiting to start on my new gig coming next month (will update that later). This mini project is basically consolidating 4D (Malaysian lotto) results from the 3 main players into a single page (perhaps a mobile app). Basically I want to be hitting this technicalities / topics:

1) Web scraping (API scraping if need be)
2) API implementation with node js
3) NOSQL integration 
4) Deployment with containers (Docker)
4) Android (and perhaps even iphone) app development and deployment

I'll document my steps and experience and hope to create a tutorial of sorts from this experience.
