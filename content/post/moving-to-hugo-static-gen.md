I don't believe it. It's been so long since I actually written to any blogs. I use to have lots of them and write quite regularly to some. They were primarily on Wordpress and Blogspot. But that was over more than a decade ago. 

So you can only imagine how outdated I am with all of this. And after going through some articles and youtube videos, I stumbled upon Scott Hanselman's video about starting a static webpage with Azure at no cost. That got me thinking, what if I could generate static pages without having to create one via Wordpress - yes, when I decided to restart my blogging efforts, the first thing I thought of was Wordpress. Lo and behold, I found the the tutorial [Learning Static Site Building with Hugo](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-static-site-building-with-hugo-2)

So there it is, I am starting to build this site and I just added my [About me](/about) page too.
